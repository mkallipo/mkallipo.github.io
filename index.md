I'm a mathematician **[^1]** holding a Ph.D from the [University of Athens, Greece](https://en.math.uoa.gr){:target="_blank"}. As a researcher in Mathematics, I'm passionate about tackling complex problems and devising innovative solutions. After spending several years in postdoctoral positions, I've switched to Data Science, excited to use my analytical skills to solve real-world problems. 

As of April 2023 I have been a member of the [OpenAIRE Graph Team](https://graph.openaire.eu/team){:target="_blank"}. 

Feel free to contact me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/myrto-kallipoliti-212716146/){:target="_blank"} page.

Thank you for visiting.
