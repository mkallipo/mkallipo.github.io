I'm a mathematician holding a Ph.D from the [University of Athens, Greece](https://en.math.uoa.gr){:target="_blank"}. As a researcher in Mathematics, I'm passionate about tackling complex problems and devising innovative solutions. After spending several years in postdoctoral positions, I've embarked on a journey into Data Science, eager to apply my analytical skills to address real-world challenges. 

I am currently employed by [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu){:target="_blank"}.
