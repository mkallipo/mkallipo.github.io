I am a mathematician holding a Ph.D from the <code style="color : gold">[University of Athens, Greece]</code>(https://en.math.uoa.gr). As a researcher in Mathematics, I am passionate about exploring complex problems and finding innovative solutions. My journey led me to Data Science, where I am excited to apply my analytical skills to address real-world challenges. 

I am currently employed by [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu).
