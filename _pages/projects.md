I use Python (Pandas) for my projects. 

- ### Project 7: Affiliation matching algorithm.
  Map raw affiliation strings to organization persistent identifiers, like ROR IDs.

- ### Project 6: Extract data from [ClinVar.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/)

- ### Project 5: Researcher's performance (self-motivated).
Retrieved data from [OpenAIRE](https://www.openaire.eu).


- ###  Project 4: Restaurant feedback (in collaboration with Exclusivi). 

- ### Project 3: Bakery sales (in collaboration with Exclusivi). 

- ### Project 2: Chocolate bars (part of DataCamp Competitions).
  Goal:\
  Explore if the chocolate bars with the highest ratings share any characteristics that could help narrow the search for suppliers (e.g., cacao percentage, bean country of origin,   etc.)\
  Steps:
  - Organize and clean the data.
  - Exploratory data analysis.
  - Visualization (I used seaborn and matplotlib for this project).
  - Conclusion: The best chocolate bars share the following characteristics:
    - Continent of the company: Oceania, 
    - Continent of the bean: South America, 
    - Ingredients: Beans, Sugar, Cocoa butter, 
    - Cocoa percent: Between 68 and 75. 
  



- ### Project 1: Analyzing the effectiveness of test preparation courses (part of DataCamp Competitions).
  Goal:\
  Examine the efficacy of test preparation courses offered by a specific educational institution and delve into the impact of parental education levels on students' test scores.
